<h3>Hi There! üëã</h3>

<p>My name is Brittany Frederick. I‚Äôve been working with data for the past 7 years. I‚Äôve been using data for many projects like building dashboards and infographics for executive leadership to monitor KPIs, 
    determining whether extracts from carrots can induce antiproliferative activity of cancer cells, playing ‚Äúdetective‚Äù and identifying patterns or determining answers to complex questions, or quantifying 
    the shelf life of manufactured breaded chicken breasts. I‚Äôve mostly worked in the food space (research, manufacturing, distribution, e-grocery). Me and data have a unique history together that I‚Äôd like to walk you through!</p>

<p>It all started when I began graduate school in 2016 where I studied food science. My thesis project involved extracting specific compounds from carrots, putting them on cancer cells in vitro, and seeing if the 
    carrot compounds induced antiproliferative effects on the cancer cells. You can read my completed thesis <b><a href="https://scholarworks.uark.edu/etd/2685/">here</a></b>. It was during my time at graduate school 
    that I discovered the power of utilizing R for data analysis. I found myself in a situation where I was doing the exact same experiment over and over, and it took an extremely long time to analyze the data from start to finish. 
    ‚ÄúHow could I save myself some time here?‚Äù, I thought. I discovered R through a statistics course I took and soon realized I could write a script in R 
    that would automate my data analytics from the outputs of my weekly experiments.</p>

<p>After I completed graduate school in 2018, I started my career at HelloFresh where I still work today as a senior data analyst in the food safety and quality department. 
    In this role, I serve to translate complex questions into understandable insights for executive leadership. I‚Äôve also become known as a ‚Äútech savvy‚Äù person on the team, 
    so I utilize my spreadsheet skills to automate a variety of tasks for the teams. (I personally LOVE these projects as they feel like big puzzles). I also engineer and 
    manage dashboards so the department can swiftly and easily monitor KPIs and metrics. I quite enjoy this role as I get to challenge myself daily to find patterns that 
    no one else sees; I monitor customer survey data, customer complaint data, recipe quality data, and food safety incident data to identify any correlations or root causes 
    for issues to help the department make prompt corrective actions and provide the highest quality food possible for our customers. In 2020 while working at HelloFresh, 
    I earned a company wide award for <b>‚ÄúMost Data Driven Employee‚Äù</b> out of 10,000 employees üèÜ. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve recently obtained a professional certificate from IBM in data science, where I completed coursework and hands-on capstone projects on data visualization / data analysis 
    with R and Python, machine learning, predictive modeling, SQL and databases, and more.</p>

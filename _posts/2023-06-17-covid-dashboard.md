# Global COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted millions worldwide, with vaccination emerging as one of the most effective methods to combat its spread. However, vaccine distribution has been uneven across regions, creating disparities in protection levels. This project was created to monitor and visualize global vaccination progress, offering insights into the pace and scale of vaccine administration on a daily basis.

## Task
As the lead data analyst, my primary responsibility was to design and build a dynamic dashboard to track key vaccination metrics worldwide. Collaborating with the project team, we selected relevant data sources and metrics, using Tableau to create an interactive tool. This dashboard enables users to analyze global vaccine distribution data in real-time.

## Action
I utilized the Our World in Data COVID vaccination dataset, which compiles current data from official government and health sources. Key dashboard metrics include:
- Population vaccination percentages
- Daily vaccine doses and booster doses administered
- Vaccination performance relative to GDP

The dashboard includes map visualizations and filters for date, country, and continent, creating an intuitive experience for users. A preview of the dashboard is shown below.

## Result
The dashboard has become a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and the public, enabling a better understanding of global vaccination progress and identifying areas that may need additional support. Some notable impacts include:
- Improved transparency and accountability in vaccination tracking
- Enhanced coordination among global health agencies
- Accelerated efforts toward achieving herd immunity in key regions

## Reflection
This project underscored the importance of data visualization in conveying complex global health data effectively. It also reinforced the role of teamwork in project success. Future improvements would focus on incorporating more real-time data sources and further optimizing the dashboard for usability.

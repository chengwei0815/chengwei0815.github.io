### Introduction
In the world of sales, having access to clear, actionable insights is key to making informed decisions. This user story outlines the creation of two dynamic dashboards using Tableau, designed to provide stakeholders—including sales managers and executives—with a comprehensive view of sales performance and customer data. By analyzing sales trends, product performance, and customer behaviors, these dashboards will help teams optimize their sales strategies and improve customer engagement.

### Sales Dashboard | Requirements

#### Dashboard Purpose
The primary goal of the sales dashboard is to provide an at-a-glance overview of the key sales metrics and trends. This allows users to analyze year-over-year sales performance, spot emerging trends, and identify areas of improvement. The dashboard will act as a tool for monitoring sales performance on a monthly and weekly basis and provide a comparison of sales by product subcategories.

#### Key Requirements

##### KPI Overview
- Display a summary of total sales, profits, and quantities for both the current year and the previous year. This will provide an overall snapshot of sales performance.

##### Sales Trends
- Present sales data for each key performance indicator (KPI) on a monthly basis for both the current year and the previous year.
- Highlight months with the highest and lowest sales to make trends easily recognizable.

##### Product Subcategory Comparison
- Compare sales performance by different product subcategories for both years.
- Include a comparison of sales and profit to identify product areas contributing the most to the bottom line.

##### Weekly Trends for Sales & Profit
- Show weekly sales and profit data for the current year.
- Display average weekly values to help identify trends.
- Highlight weeks that exceed or fall short of the average to draw attention to notable sales or profit spikes.

### Customer Dashboard | Requirements

#### Dashboard Purpose
The customer dashboard is designed to offer a comprehensive view of customer data, including key trends and behaviors. It will provide valuable insights into customer segments, purchase patterns, and profitability, which can inform marketing efforts and customer relationship management.

#### Key Requirements

##### KPI Overview
- Display a summary of the total number of customers, total sales per customer, and total number of orders for both the current and previous years.

##### Customer Trends
- Present customer-related data on a monthly basis for both the current and previous years.
- Identify months with the highest and lowest sales for easier trend recognition.

##### Customer Distribution by Number of Orders
- Visualize the distribution of customers based on the number of orders they’ve placed. This will provide insights into customer behavior, engagement, and loyalty.

##### Top 10 Customers By Profit
- Display the top 10 customers who have generated the highest profits for the company.
- Include additional details such as customer rank, number of orders, current sales, current profit, and the date of their last order.

### Design & Interactivity Requirements

#### Dashboard Dynamic
- **Historical Data Access**:  
  Users should be able to select any desired year to view historical data. This flexibility enables users to analyze long-term trends and compare data across multiple years.

#### Navigation & Interactivity
- The dashboards should be easy to navigate, allowing users to seamlessly switch between the sales and customer dashboards.
- The charts and graphs should be interactive, enabling users to filter data directly from the visuals.

#### Data Filters
- Provide filters for product information such as category and subcategory, as well as for location data like region, state, and city. This will allow users to drill down into specific datasets for more granular insights.

### Conclusion
These two dashboards in Tableau will provide a powerful way for stakeholders to monitor sales performance and customer behavior. The sales dashboard will give executives the tools they need to make informed decisions regarding product performance, while the customer dashboard will allow marketing and customer service teams to understand customer trends and improve customer relationships. With dynamic and interactive features, these dashboards will make it easier than ever to visualize key data, compare performance over time, and identify opportunities for growth.
